Proudly powered by Red Bull Racing spirit,   bad life choices, nicotine, 5 cans of Red Bull per day, and a surprisingly strong love for cars.


# Finals? Again? ew.

Welcome to the land of last-minute survival.  
This is a collection of study notes made by someone who's running purely on caffeine, energy drink, and bad decisions.

## Subjects Covered
- Calculus II (yes it still exists)

## Why does this repo exist?

Because I’m tired. You’re tired.  
But we still gotta pass.  
This repo was built on 5 cans of Red Bull a day, nicotine, and the kind of regret you only get from solving 3 pages of calculus at 2 AM.

If it helps you survive finals, then it’s all worth it.

## Bonus Encouragement

> *“You’re not bad at this. You’re just tired.”*  
> *“You’re smarter than you give yourself credit for. You always were.”*  
> *“It’s okay if this part feels tough. Not being good at something doesn’t mean you’re not brilliant. You are.”*  
> *“You’re sharper than you realize. You pick things up so fast — it's just that sometimes you're too chill to notice.”*  
> *“Trust your brain a little more. You always figure things out faster than you think.”*
